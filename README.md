Amazon Alexa - Fashion News Skill 

## Project description

Implementation of Fashion News Alexa Skill has the following steps:
<ul>
    <li>Alexa Skill created under <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">Amazon developer console</a> using Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) for german and english languages</li>
    <li>Serverless Lambda function created on AWS in Ireland region</li>
    <li>Backend deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk in Ireland region</li>
</ul>

Lambda function <a href="src/fashionNewsLambda.py">fashionNewsLambda</a> handles Alexa Skills Kit requests. Lambda fetches all data (e.g. news, articles, stores) from backend.
<br>
Backend - RESTful web service using Spring Boot and Spring Data (out of scope for this repository).
<br>

Skill has the following key utterances for english language (you could find all supported utterances under <a href="speechAssets">speechAssets</a> folder):
- Whatâ€™s new on fashion
- Tell me latest fashion trends 
- Read the fashion article
- Where can I buy jeans nearby

This skill can build decision tree based on user's response. 
For example, after telling fashion trends, Alexa suggests to read today's fashion article.
